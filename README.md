# Jello-Cube-Simulator

Uses OpenGL to simulate a jello cube structure made up of a mass spring system. The jello cube has collision detection and response implemented so that it bounces off the bounding box's edges. There are also forces inside the box that influence the jello cube to move around.

An inclined plane intersects the bounding box and creates another edge to check for collision detection.
